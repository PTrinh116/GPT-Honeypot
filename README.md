# A STUDY OF ADAPTIVE SSH HONEYPOT APPLYING LANGUAGE MODEL 
## Project Overview
This project enhances traditional honeypots by addressing the "trilemma" of realism, long-term interaction, and resource efficiency. By integrating ChatGPT with prompt management and terminal protocol simulation, it effectively simulates complex, prolonged attacks while optimizing resources and analyzing attacker behavior.

## Key Features
Prompt Manager: Dynamically manages prompts, ensuring consistency and optimal context for ChatGPT.
ChatGPT: Generates realistic responses using "Chain of Thought" strategies for long-term interactions.

## Results
High Realism: Outperforms other models in generating realistic responses.
Efficiency: Matches Cowrie in resource efficiency.
Logic Consistency: Superior adherence to OS logic compared to Cowrie and LLMHoneypot.
